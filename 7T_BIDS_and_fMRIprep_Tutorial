This file describes step-by-step how to BIDSify 7T files and run fMRI prep

To BIDSify 7T data: 

1. Download the following from flywheel (dcm and nii.gz files): 
* Refer to subject_tracker_all.xlsx on Box for T1 and Bold filenames
   - T1
   - BOLD
   - TOPUP

2. Put dicoms in their own folder within one big folder and scp all into PMACS

3. unzip asdf.dicom.zip 

4. module load dcm2niix 

5. dcm2niix * (Generates niis plus the json file)

6. scp the jsons back to local. Delete *.dcm and *.nii to save space. 

7. BIDSify json and nii.gz filenames: 
   generic format: 
   sub-[subj]_ses-[ses#]_task-rest_bold.json
   sub-[subj]_ses-[ses#]_dir-PA_run-1_epi.json
   sub-[subj]_ses-[ses#]_T1w.json
     
   examples:
   sub-80557_ses-10738_task-rest_bold.json
   sub-80557_ses-10738_dir-PA_run-1_epi.json
   sub-80557_ses-10738_T1w.json
  
8. Add the following line to the fmap json:
   "IntendedFor": ["ses-10738/func/sub-80557_ses-10738_task-rest_bold.nii.gz"],

9. Add the following line to the func json:
   "TaskName": "rest"
   
10. Submit subject folder to BIDS validator:
    https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/

11. If valid, scp subject folder into PMACS! Ready to run fMRIprep!
    Current folder (To be updated soon): /project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/7T_2/


To run fMRI prep: 
QUEUE=bbl ibash
bsub "sh fmriprep_nick.sh"

*Note: Do not need to run "ssh singularity01" since singularity image is already installed.
