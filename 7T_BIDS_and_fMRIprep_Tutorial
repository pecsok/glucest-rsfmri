This file describes step-by-step how to BIDSify 7T files and run fMRI prep

To BIDSify 7T data: 

1a. Download the following from flywheel (dcm and nii.gz files): 
* Refer to subject_tracker_all.xlsx on Box for T1 and Bold filenames

1b. Set up folders:
   session=####
   bblid=#####
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}/
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}/anat
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}/func
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}/fmap
   cp ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/dataset_description.json ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}
    
2. Put dicoms in their own folder within one big folder and scp all into PMACS
   # mkdirs
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_Dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_Dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/anat
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_Dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/func
   mkdir ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_Dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/fmap
   
   # mv files into respective folders. Then, scp dicom folder to PMACS:
   scp -r ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_Dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms pecsok@bblsub.pmacs.upenn.edu:/project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/dicoms/
 
3. unzip asdf.dicom.zip 

4. module load dcm2niix 

5. dcm2niix * (Generates niis plus the json file)
   unzip *
   dcm2niix *
   rm *.dcm
   rm *.nii

6. scp UNI and INV2 files into PMACS: /project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/anat2
   scp -r ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}/anat/ pecsok@bblsub.pmacs.upenn.edu:/project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/anat

7. fslmaths to create mprage from UNI and INV2
   source /project/bbl_projects/apps/default_modules.sh 
   fslmaths sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_T1w.nii.gz -mul sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_UNI.nii.gz sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_T1w
   scp pecsok@bblsub.pmacs.upenn.edu:/project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/anat/anat/sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_T1w_combined.nii.gz ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}/anat/  
   
   
6. scp the jsons and the mprage back to local. Delete *.dcm and *.nii to save space and time.
   scp -r pecsok@bblsub.pmacs.upenn.edu:/project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_Dicoms/${bblid}_dicoms/
 
7. BIDSify json and nii.gz filenames: 
   cd ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/sub-${bblid}/ses-${ses}
   generic format: 
   sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_task-rest_bold.json
   sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_dir-PA_run-1_epi.json
   sub-${bblid}_ses-${ses}_T1w.json

  
8. Add the following line to the fmap json:
   "IntendedFor": ["ses-10738/func/sub-80557_ses-10738_task-rest_bold.nii.gz"],

9. Add the following line to the func json:
   "TaskName": "rest"
   
10. Submit subject folder to BIDS validator:
    https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/
   
11. If valid, scp subject folder into PMACS! Ready to run fMRIprep!
    Current folder (To be updated soon): 
    scp -r ~/Desktop/Maggie/Graduate\ School/Project1-GluCEST-rsfMRI/7T_BIDS_and_DICOMS/7T_${bblid}/ pecsok@bblsub.pmacs.upenn.edu:/project/bbl_roalf_22qmidline/maggiesandbox/subject/7T/

To run fMRI prep: 
QUEUE=bbl ibash
bsub "sh fmriprep_nick.sh"

*Note: Do not need to run "ssh singularity01" since singularity image is already installed.
